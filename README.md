# React Shopping Cart and Payment Processor (POS)

This was my first production ReactJS app back from React 15.1.
It is used at live seminar events which need a POS to process product sales at the event using credit cards, checks, or cash. It is run on a laptop with a usb credit card swiper. 

## Getting Started

It is made to fit into an existing laravel project and therefore, you would need to know the laravel directory system and asset management to put it into the project. I am not adding this repo so it can be fully reproduced, but in the hopes that someone might find ideas/inspiration when looking to build similar components.

## Running the tests

The associated unit tests are all in the original laravel project and are not included here
